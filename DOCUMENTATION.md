# Future improvements
- Add Error Handling and Logging:
It’s important to handle potential issues during file downloads and parsing. You can also implement a retry mechanism for failed downloads to make the pipeline more robust.
- Explore More Sophisticated Chunking:
This current pipeline provides basic chunking. In the future, you might consider more advanced methods—such as semantic chunking—by leveraging LLMs.
- Store Data in a Database or Other Storage:
Currently, the pipeline writes chunks to a JSONL file. You could save chunks in a database or other storage system and generate embeddings for better retrieval and search.
- Change the Output Format as Needed:
JSONL is convenient for many use cases, but you can adapt the pipeline to produce any format that suits your workflow (e.g., CSV, Parquet, or direct database inserts).
- Use a Vector Database and Knowledge Graph:
Consider dividing your metadata so that general information goes into a vector database (for semantic searches), while factual information is stored in a knowledge graph. This lets you create relationships between entities, define principal nodes and their properties, and achieve both semantic (vector) and relational (graph) search—sometimes referred to as a “dual search” approach.

# Overall Pipeline Flow

## 1) fetch_documents(urls)

Purpose: Download each file (PDF or PPTX) from a list of URLs and save them locally.
Key points:
It creates a local directory (e.g., documents) if it doesn’t exist.
It figures out a suitable filename from the URL (especially needed for the Microsoft slides).
It streams the download in chunks (so we don’t load an entire file into memory at once).
If the download succeeds, it appends the local file path to local_paths.
Finally, it returns the list of downloaded file paths.

## 2) parse_file(filepath, parser)

Purpose: Use a special Llama-based parser (LlamaParse) to extract textual content from a PDF or PPTX.
Key points:
Internally calls parser.load_data(filepath), which processes the file and returns a list of “Document-like” objects.
Each returned document typically has at least two attributes: text (the raw textual content) and metadata (dictionary of metadata).
If there's an error (e.g., file type isn’t supported), it returns an empty list instead of crashing.


## 3) chunk_data(documents, splitter)

Purpose: Take each Document’s text and split it into smaller pieces (chunks) for easier processing.
Key points:
It loops through every Document object in documents.
Uses the splitter (a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain) to split the Document’s text into chunks.
For each chunk, it also runs classification to determine its category (more on classification below).
Builds a dictionary that includes:
a unique chunk_id,
the actual chunk text (content),
metadata like source filename, page number, doc type, etc.
Collects all chunk dictionaries in a list (all_chunks), which it then returns.


## 4) classify_document(text)

Purpose: Looks for specific keywords to categorize a piece of text into a predefined category (or “Unknown” if no match).
Key points:
We have a global CATEGORIES dictionary, where each key is a category and its value is a list of associated keywords.
The function checks if any of those keywords appear in the text (case-insensitive).
Returns the first matching category or “Unknown” if it doesn’t find any matches.


## 5) Writing Output to JSONL

Purpose: Once each chunk is created, we serialize it to JSON and append it line-by-line to a .jsonl (JSON Lines) file.
Key points:
Each chunk is written as a single line in the JSONL file.
JSONL format is convenient for large datasets because you can read it line-by-line.


## 6) The main() Function

Purpose: Orchestrate all steps in the correct order.
Steps inside main():
Load environment: (e.g., load_dotenv()) for API keys if needed.
Initialize parser and text splitter: So they’re ready for use in subsequent steps.
Fetch documents: Download each file and get the saved file paths.
Parse each file: Convert file content to text using parse_file.
Inject metadata: The Llama parser might return Documents with minimal metadata; we add source filename, doc type, etc.
Chunk the Documents: Break the text into smaller segments.
Write each chunk to a .jsonl file.


# Summary of the Logic

Download the files from external URLs.
Parse each file with Llama so you get structured text objects (Document objects).
Chunk those Document objects using a text splitter.
Classify each chunk by keyword.
Store the final chunk data (content + metadata) in a JSONL file.
This “pipeline” approach makes it easy to maintain, debug, and extend each step independently (e.g., replace the parser, change the splitter, or improve the classification strategy) without breaking the rest of the code.
